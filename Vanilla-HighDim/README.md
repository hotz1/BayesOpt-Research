# BayesOpt-Research/Vanilla-HighDim

This directory within the repository contains my work on a subsequent project related to Bayesian optimization which is primarily inspired by the work in the paper *Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions* by Carl Hvarfner, Erik O. Hellsten, and Luigi Nardi.
