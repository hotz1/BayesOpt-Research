# BayesOpt-Research/EULBO

This directory within the repository contains my work on a project related to Bayesian optimization through the EULBO (Expected Utility Lower Bound) as a means to make `BayesOpt` algorithms more efficient by linearly transforming data through an action matrix. 

This directory includes comparisons of multiple different Bayesian optimization algorithms which are simulated through Python scripts.
