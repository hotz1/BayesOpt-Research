# Weekly Log

This is a weekly log of what work I have done on tasks for this resarch project. I have split the work up (roughly) by week, although that is probably not a perfect system. 

## Current & Ongoing Tasks

- [x] Create + organize Git repository for the research project
- [x] Create weekly log for task management
- [ ] Complete Gaussian distribution (STAT 520P) problem set
- [ ] Read Gaussian Processes paper (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15449>)
- [ ] Read additional Gaussian Process/Bayesian Optimization notes
- [ ] Brush up on linear algebra
- [ ] Set up Python locally
