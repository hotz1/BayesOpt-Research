# Weekly Log

This is a weekly log of what work I have done on tasks for this resarch project. I have split the work up (roughly) by week, along with a separate section at the top for ongoing work/tasks.

## Current & Ongoing Tasks

- Theory-Related
    * [ ] Read Bayesian Optimization paper (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15449>)
    * [ ] Brush up on linear algebra
    * [ ] Create and update theory/project notes document
- Coding-Related
    * [ ] Relearn general Python syntax and code (I am too used to working with R)
    * [ ] Relearn `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy` library syntax
    * [ ] Learn how to use the Pytorch (`torch`) libraries
